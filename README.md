# A.D.A.S [Automated Driving Assessment System]🏎️
<p align="justify"> A.D.A.S is an AI device that can analyze and detect reckless driving behavior in real time. It uses a MPU-6050 sensor that works with a Naïve Bayes classifier to track the vehicle’s speed. The device alerts the drivers when they exceed the speed limit or drive dangerously, and keeps track of the warnings in a mobile app that links to a Firebase database. </p>

### Background💡
<p align="justify"> In the urban area of Indonesia, there are a lot of vehicles, whether motorcycles or cars, which are being driven irresponsibly. As we all know, drivers’ arbitrary action results in traffic accidents. Sudden line change or braking, low driving skill, and reckless driving are only a few of the factors that affect these behaviors, and we are aware that the police are unable to keep a constant watch on these drivers. Several attempts were made to reduce the number of accidents by the use of speed cameras, speed ramps, and the supervision of the police. However, accidents still occur because these solutions cannot keep track of every road at every time to detect reckless driving and prevent accidents or crashes from happening. </p>
